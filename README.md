# BreastCancerDetection
Using Support Vector Macines (SVM) I was able to classify tumors into Malignant/Beningn with 97% accuracy. This technique can rapidly evaluate breast masses and classify them in an augmented fashion. Early Breast Cancer candramatically save lives especially in the developing world.
This technique can be further improved by combining Computer Vision techniques to directly classify cancer using tissue Images
